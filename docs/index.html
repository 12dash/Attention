      <h4>Attention Mechanism</h4>
      <p>
        The attention mechanism was introduced in this paper
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf"
          >Attention is all you need!</a
        >
        that provided competition to the then state of the art Seq2Seq modeling
        components like Recurrent Neural Network i.e. LSTM, GRU. As the name
        suggests, <b>Attention is all you need</b> to capture sequential
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's get into some equations now. We have three variables in
        <b>Scaled Dot Product Attention</b>: \(Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d}, < K \in
        \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}, V \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_v}> \)
      </p>
      <p class="equations">
        $$ \text{Un-normalized Attention} = \text{Q} \cdot \text{K}^T$$
      </p>
      <p>
        where Q is the query vector, K is sequence of Key vector and d is the
        dimension of the vectors. T is the total number of time steps or
        sequence length we are considering.
      </p>
      <p class="intuition">
        The intuition behind this is to find cosine similarity between the two
        vector \( \text{Q }\& \text{ K}_t \) at timestep t. The cosine
        similarlity acts as a weightage to the corresponding value vector i.e.
        \( V_t \)
      </p>
      <p>
        Since these are weightage we would like the scores to be somewhat
        smaller in value ideally close to the range \([0, 3] \) The upper bound
        3 is arbitary. I just came up with that : ). The point is we want scores
        that are somewhat close to each other in magnitude and the lowest is 0
        which means do not given any attention to that timestamp in the
        sequence. Hence we normalize the above quantity by taking a softmax. The
        factor of \(\sqrt{d}\) is also multiplied to reduce the magnitude so
        that it does not push the values of the softmax in regions that have
        very small gradients.
      </p>
      <p class="equations">
        $$\text{Normalized Attention} = \text{softmax}(\frac{\text{Q} \cdot
        \text{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}})$$ The shape of the above is going to be \(
        \text{T} \) i.e. a T dimensional vector where each dimension corresponds
        to the attention given to the value vector at that timestep.
        $$\text{Attention Value} = \text{softmax}(\frac{\text{Q} \cdot
        \text{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}})V$$
      </p>
      Lastly we get the attention value which is essentially multiplying the
      normalized attention we calculated for each timestep with the
      corresponding value.
